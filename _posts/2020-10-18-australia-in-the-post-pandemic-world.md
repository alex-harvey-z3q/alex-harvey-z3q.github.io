## Abstract

> As Australia enters the post-pandemic world, we will be forced to make difficult public health and economic choices. Our policies currently aim to build and maintain a robust public health infrastructure for containment of Covid-19 until a vaccine is available. As we learn more about the virus, however, and as domestic and international situations evolve, our policies must be ready to adapt. In the short term, our containment strategies must further emulate those of successful countries including Taiwan, South Korea, Iceland, Senegal and others. If our containment fails, however, or if the international situation changes, we must be ready to adopt other policies, even beyond containment, including Sweden's focused protection. Further lockdowns should be ruled out of consideration under any circumstances.

## Introduction

In February, 2020, as Covid-19, the scenes of streets deserted in South Korea provided early warning to us in Australia that a probably unstoppable viral pandemic was on its way, a matter of only time. The Korea outbreak in the city of Daegu had come a few weeks after the Chinese central government had quarantined the entire city of Wuhan, and its population of 11 million souls. A lockdown in a free country like Korea, however, seemed unlikely. Authorities in Daegu, instead, set about to test hundreds of thousands of people, as its citizens instinctively wore face masks to limit the spread.

By March 17th, Science Mag wrote of South Korea's surprising success. Europe had by now become the epicenter of pandemic. Deaths were soaring in Italy, Spain, France, and Germany, and the countries of the EU had, one by one, copied the policies of China in Wuhan, and closed their borders and ordered lockdowns.

Not South Korea however. South Korea's Kim Woo-Joo, an infectious disease specialist at Korea University, said:

> South Korea is a democratic republic, we feel a lockdown is not a reasonable choice.

In this article, I make the argument that Australia's containment policies are inadequate, that success so far outside of Victoria just shows that other states have been lucky, and we must adopt both the containment policies of the Asian nations as well as their attitude towards lockdowns. That is to say, we must stop the lockdowns.

## Part I - Containment

Australia began the pandemic in a lucky position. We have have no land borders, a low population density, and a warm, sunny climate. The prime minister's decision to ban travel from China was also a good decision that made a difference to the evolution of the pandemic. We also purchased a lot of test kits and implemented many tests per day. Australia was one of the leaders in tests-per-day-per-population.

But Western nations have struggled with balancing personal freedoms with the need to contain a virus. Our attitudes towards freedom have been inconsistent. We need to recognise that avoiding severe and economically catastrophic losses of freedom that come from lockdowns, we must be willing to give up minor freedoms.

### Mandatory testing

##### Recommendation 1: Australian and State governments must be willing to compel people who are suspected of infection to be tested.

The CHO in Australia has the power to enforce mandatory testing. However, he has stated that the government does not wish for testing to be mandatory. Consider the case of South Korean Patient 31. A member of religious sect, Patient 31 refused doctors advice twice to be tested. The testing came in conflict with her religious beliefs. In the end, she personally infected over 1,000 people, over a number of days. Australia cannot take such a risk of, what I will call, a Patient 31 event.

### Mandatory surveillance

##### Recommendation 2: Australia should adopt a system similar to China's or Taiwan's that allows phone location data to be used. Failing that, COVIDSafe or similar must at least be mandatory.

Contact tracing in Australia is done manually by teams of contact tracers who speak to infected individuals, and find the names and contact details of others who may have been infected. But given a virus that can spread exponentially, such methods do not scale beyond a small number of cases per day. And if contact tracing capacity is exceeded, then governments tend to order economically harmful restrictions and even lockdowns. 

In China it is different. The central government is willing to use mobile phone data to track infections. The Chinese had an app very early in the pandemic for this. In Taiwan, everyone can be monitored by satellite and mobile phone signals. The system is used both to monitor individuals in quarantine, and also to obtain close contacts during the infectious period.

Such data is invaluable in contact tracing. And considering the alternative of complete loss of freedom in lockdown, again this minor freedom must be surrendered to contain this virus.

The federal government of course provided the COVIDSafe app and encouraged everyone to download it. This of course failed, and the app appears to have been of almost no use in contact tracing at all.

### Mandatory quarantine

##### Recommendation 3: Self-isolation orders should be monitored by surveillance.

Perhaps even more concerning is that Australia as well as other Western nations generally ask infected Covid-19 patients to "self-isolate for 14 days". This self-isolation is mandatory, and there are significant penalties for failing to obey. In NSW, for example, there is an $11,000 fine or a 6 months prison sentence. Other states are similar, although in the Northern Territory it is only a $1,256 fine.

These are tough penalties, although we know that people can and do breach the self-isolation orders, all the same. Spot checks in NSW had already found 14 cases of people breaching the self-isolation orders, by 1st April. In late August, during Victoria's second lockdown, it was revealed that 50 people had been fined for breaching self-isolation orders.

With people known to be breaching the self-isolation orders, it should be obvious that it is only a matter of time until a Patient 31 event occurs. Indeed, this has already happened, and more than once. On 28th August it was revealed to the Victorian hotel quarantine inquiry that a security guard had been ordered to self-isolate, but breached the order. Meanwhile, in NSW, it was revealed that a hotel quarantine security guard in NSW was fine twice for breaching self-isolation orders.

This same critical mistake was made in Iceland. Two French tourists arrived for a holiday and tested positive for the virus. They were ordered to self-isolate but instead went out to clubs. This caused Iceland's second wave.

The Asian nations again do this differently. In Hong Kong, instead of self-isolation orders, people are given wristbands and they are monitored. Likewise in Taiwan, people ordered to isolate are monitored by phone signals and satellite.

We must do this too.

## Part II - Treatment and prophylaxis

### Treatment

##### Recommendation 4: TGA should approve a 2-track approvals process to allow safe medicines that have shown promise in studies to be used early by doctors.

Australia and a number of other western nations have onerous approvals processes for new therapeutics, typically requiring them to proceed to large Phase III randomised trials. This process typically takes years. However, nations that have successfully managed Covid-19 have adopted empirical approaches to new therapeutics. China, South Korea, Senegal and many other nations adopted anti-viral treatments early in the pandemic. In some cases, Senegal for example, country-wide approaches based typically on Hydroxychloroquine were adopted. In others, such as South Korea and China, a range of treatments were recommended at the discretion of doctors.

At this time there are many repurposed anti-viral drugs that show promise, including controversial ones like Hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin, and less well-known ones such as Interferons.

### Prophylaxis

##### Recommendation 5: TGA should make safe drugs that have shown promise available to be used in health-care and other high-risk patients and the elderly.

Some countries notably India have also approved therapeutics as chemoprophylaxis, namely Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin. Again, however, there a number of emerging options.

### Vitamin D supplementation

##### Recommendation 6: The Australian government should initiate a campaign to educate and encourage Australians to use Vitamin D supplements.

There is strong evidence that Vitamin D deficiency creates a significant risk factor for Covid-19 and may even be a driver or the main driver of the observed seasonality, of Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses. Anthony Fauci has made an informal recommendation to use Vitamin D supplements. Vitamin D deficiency may also be a side effect of social distancing, if Australians spend more time in their houses and indoors than they otherwise would have.

## Part III - Containment fails

The policies of Taiwan have, so far, contained Covid-19 in their city-state. They crushed their first wave, and have had no appreciable second wave. Australia, meanwhile, has natural advantages relative to Taiwan, including a better climate, and a lower population density.

This section discusses the worst case. What happens if, despite implementing policies like Taiwan, we still lose control of the epidemic. Here, I argue that we should _not_ continue with lockdowns, curfews and stay-at-home orders, but instead switch to policies that attempt to prevent superspreading events.

### Overdispersion and superspreading events

##### Recommendation 7: Rewrite stage 3 with restrictions that prevent superspreading events. Remove Stage 4 lockdowns completely.

Instead of lockdowns, the WHO had recommended banning public gatherings and closing schools. Banning public gatherings is known to be the non-pharmaceutical intervention that makes the real difference in limiting spread. But if governments feel compelled to go further, we must understand these facts:

- 70% of Covid-19 infections do not infect others
- The virus tends to spread via airborne aerosols
- Indoor venues with poor ventilation are associated with superspreading events, such as bars, nightclubs, churches
- Cool and damp conditions are especially favourable to superspreading, such as meat factories
- Time spent in these locations is associated with superspreading.

We could therefore look to the example of Iceland, after its case explosion in August. The Icelandic epidemiologist ordered bars, and gyms to close. Gatherings were limited to 20 people.

### Backwards contact tracing

##### Recommendation 8: Contact tracers must use backwards contact tracing methods.

Following on from the observation that Covid-19 is highly overdispersed, arises the idea of backwards contact tracing. Instead of contacting every contact of an infection, even though it is known that 70% will not be infected, better instead for contact tracers to instead focus on finding and quarantining the superspreader that started the cluster. 

### Why lockdowns are not useful

#### Very early lockdowns

On August 18th, the government of New Zealand ordered a _second_ lockdown after the country recorded a tiny 13 cases after months of no transmission. Notice that if NSW had initiated lockdowns each time it recorded 13 cases, the state of NSW would have been in lockdown as much as Victoria. The following chart shows cases-per-day in NSW over 6 months (source: covid19data.com.au):

![NSW]({{ "/assets/nsw_cases.png" | absolute_url }})

The longer-term economic consequences of New Zealand's experiments with rolling lockdowns are yet to be felt. The government has so far spent 20% of GDP, its JobSeeker-equivalent has flowed to almost 60% of workers. We will know in years to come how much of this burden has been shifted onto New Zealand's children and grandchildren.

#### Victoria's late lockdown

The lockdown implemented in Victoria meanwhile came earlier enough to eventually suppress the epidemic (probable but not certain), but not early enough to avoid over 800 deaths. The economic consequences to Victoria appear more severe even than in New Zealand, so Victoria's late lockdown appears to be a worst-of-all-worlds scenario. 

#### EU's very late lockdowns

Meanwhile, lockdowns in Europe in the first wave appear to have come so late in the epidemic that the epidemic was already in decline at the time of lockdown orders. These very late lockdowns appear to have had no impact at all on the evolution of the epidemic and could even have exacerbated indoor spread.

#### Lockdowns have no place in pandemic management

The uncomfortable but inescapable conclusion is that lockdowns have no place in modern pandemic management. Indeed, WHO pandemic preparedness documents do not, and have never, recommended lockdowns. The following screenshot shows the WHO's 2005 pandemic preparedness checklist section on social distancing and quarantine. Lockdowns are not mentioned in any documents:

![Checklist]({{ "/assets/checklist.png" | absolute_url }})

The WHO coronavirus envoy Dr. David Nabarro has recently urged world leaders not to lockdowns as a primary control method:

> The only time we believe a lockdown in justified is to buy you time to reorganise, regroup, rebalance your resources; protect your health workers who are exhausted," Dr Nabarro said. But by and large, we'd rather not do it.

Similarly, countries like Germany, Norway, Switzerland and others already conceded that their March lockdowns were overreactions.

The case of the New Zealand lockdowns is interesting. According to WHO advice, updated in this pandemic, their first lockdown _may_ have been justifiable, but only if they had used that time to build containment infrastructure. But the fact of a second lockdown at only 13 cases is clearly not justifiable in terms of any pandemic best practice.

Lockdowns do not work. Political leaders must have the courage to hold their nerves, even if cases are increasing exponentially. The next section discusses the alternative.

## Part IV - Focused protection

On 17th June, 2009, at the peak of Australia's Swine Flu epidemic, the Rudd Labor government introduced a new phase in its pandemic response called PROTECT. Containment having failed, the government moved to focus on protecting people with high risk of complications from the disease. In the case of Swine Flu, this included pregnant women, a subpopulation that was particularly susceptible to Swine Flu. Testing at airports was discontinued. And the national stockpile of antiviral drugs was no longer made available to people with the flu unless there were more than mild symptoms or a high risk of dying.

Sweden's policies have been significantly misrepresented in the media and other public discussions. In reality, Sweden's policies were a suppression strategy quite similar to what was adopted by the Morrison government in Australia. Indeed, Sweden's policies essentially implement the flatten-the-curve memes that Australians shared on social media in February and early March, prior to Austalia's lockdown. For example:

![Flatten]({{ "/assets/flatten.png" | absolute_url }})

Often missed in these discussions is that Sweden had invested in a huge hospital capacity and therefore could afford to allow the virus wave to spread faster without risking hospital capacity.

Sweden's policies of focused protection were supposed to protect especially care homes. Sweden's government however claims that care homes did not implement the guidelines and this led to huge mortality in care homes. The same happened in Victoria, of course. The Royal Commission into aged care recently found that the Morrison government had failed to adequately prepare aged care homes for Covid-19.

The following chart shows excess mortality over a number of years in Sweden, the huge first wave of Covid visible at the end (source: EUROMOMO):

![Excess]({{ "/assets/Sweden_excess.png" | absolute_url }})

Another factor that also no doubt contributed to Sweden's high death rate in the first wave is also that excess mortality had been well below average in Sweden over the previous two years, leading to a build-up in people who were at high-risk of death from respiratory infection.

### Conclusion

As I write this, I am aware of huge danger, in a way I never have been before, both to public health and to Australia economy and future, posed by Covid-19. I have low confidence in the processes that are in place for containing this virus, painfully aware of how easy it is for a single mistake to lead to a superspreading event, and knowledge that Labor states in particular believe in elimination rather than suppression and have response plans based on lockdowns.

In this piece, I have argued for 8 changes to Australia's Covid-19 response:

1. Mandatory testing: The Australian governments must be willing to compel those who may be infected to be tested.
1. Mandatory surveillance: We must adopt a system of virus surveillance that includes mandatory access to mobile phone location data for use by contact tracers and in quarantine.
1. Mandatory quarantine: We must end the self-isolation for those who test positive and move to a mandatory quarantine system, ideally based on phone location tracking.
1. Early access to therapeutics: TGA should move to a 2-track approvals process to allow safe medicines that show promise of efficacy to be used at the discretion of doctors.
1. Early access to chemoprophylaxis: As with therapeutics, those at high risk of Covid-19 infection and death such as the elderly and health care workers should be able to access medicines that have shown promise as prophylactics.
1. Vitamin D supplementation: Australians should be encouraged to use Vitamin D supplements to boost immunity to Covid-19.
1. Stage 3 restrictions should be rewritten to exclusively focus on venues of superspreading such as bars, nightclubs, gyms, meat factories, etc.
1. Backwards tracing: contact tracing methodology should focus on finding and isolating superspreaders using backwards contact tracing instead of forwards tracing based on testing all contacts.
